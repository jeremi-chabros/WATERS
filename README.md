Spike detection based on continuous wavelet transform with data-driven templates



## Description

This method is an extension of the method presented in:

> Nenadic Z, Burdick JW.\
Spike detection using the continuous wavelet transform.\
IEEE Trans Biomed Eng. 2005;52(1):74-87.\
doi:10.1109/TBME.2004.839800

Through adapting custom wavelets based on spike waveforms, it creates a family of templates that are then scaled:

1. Horizontally in time domain
2. Vertically in voltage (amplitude) domain

This allows for a more robust spike detection that accounts for the physiological spike waveforms (as opposed to abstract wavelets).

## Spike detection pipeline

1. Filter the raw voltage trace (3rd order Butterworth, 600 Hz - 8 kHz)

2. Using threshold-based method detect `n ∈ [50, 1000]` spikes.

3. Using the aggregated median spike waveform adapt a custom wavelet.
